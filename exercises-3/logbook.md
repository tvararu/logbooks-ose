While completing the first exercise I made the small mistake of not calling `win.pack();` in the second example, but it was easily corrected.

One interesting thing about Java windows on the Mac OS X operating system is that closing them by using the red `x` button does not actually quit the application. Using the system-standard `CMD + Q` hotkey on the other hand does.

For the second exercise, I decided to opt for a symlink of the `TimeData.class` from the `Exercises 1` directory to make including it simpler (and not have two copies of the code in my Exercises repository).
